# Getting Started: Tools You'll Need

## GitHub
To access course material, as well as share the projects you're most proud of, *Github* comes in handy. As one of the top tools used by software developers, Github is a space for developers to collaborate through the sharing and updating of their software. 

The code of various applications and packages can be found on this site, and anyone can download/fork the code from a repository at the push of a button. 

If you're interested in creating a Github account, let me know and I'll get you started.

**UPDATE (9/26/2021):** It is now highly recommended that all members sign up for GitHub, as that makes it easier to sign up for Repl.it and share your code with me, fellow members, and the whole world!

## Repl
To share snippets of what you learned so far from this course, I highly recommend Repl.it for all members. Starting an account is easy, and you can access thousands of packages in addition to built-in modules. You must sign up [here](https://replit.com/signup). (**Bonus:** If you already have a Github account, you can use that to sign up instead of your Google account.) 

To keep things simple, your username will be your first initial (of your English name) followed by your last name in all lowercase. (If your username is already taken, add a number next to it.) For example, if your name is Eason Feng, your username will be *efeng*. However, if your name is Molly Li, and *mli* is already taken, try *mli1* or *mli2*.

If you're having trouble using Repl, please let me know and I can help.

## Python Sandbox: Turtle Mode
Since the turtle module isn't effective in Repl, we will be using [Python Sandbox: Turtle Mode](http://www.pythonsandbox.com/turtle)  for our Turtle Module lesson on Week 3. Just type your turtle code in the window and press play. You can even download your result as an image, and share it with one of us if you want.

## Foundations of Python Programming @ Runestone Academy
Though I have few years of coding experience in Python, I've revisted the basics again, using [this course](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/fopp/index.html) as a baseline. Their lessons and exercises are totally free, and each lesson, I will provide you with the links to the corresponding unit, exercises, and assessment, along with my recommended exercises. I hope you enjoy them as much as I do!

## If you already have a IDE that supports Python, that's great!
If you're using a previously installed IDE that supports Python 3 (e.g. Pycharm, VS Code, Spyder), whether it'd be on your personal computer or one of the school's desktops, feel free to use that instead of Repl for this course, as long as you let me or a facilitator know in advance. 

If you have a Github account, you can create a new repository, and add the Python files you've created to this repository, which you will then share with either via a link or my Github account *azoght*. 

**I'll be happy to see what you guys create!**
