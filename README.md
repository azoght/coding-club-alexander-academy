# coding-club-alexander-academy

My official curriculum for Alexander Academy's Coding Club

**In this course you will learn:**
- the fundamentals of Python, such as variables and operators
- how to process user input for different results every time
- the Turtle module,how it works, and what you can do with it
- how to interpret and solve errors in your Python code
- the logic behind conditional statements
- the operations you can perform on sequences
- and more!

**By the end of this course, you'll be able to:**
- recall the basic conventions of Python, how and when to use them
- program incrementally and spot errors along the way
- create cummulative projects that combine all you've learned in this course
- seek new opportunities with Python and beyond (who knows, maybe you'll decide to take it in uninversity or college)
